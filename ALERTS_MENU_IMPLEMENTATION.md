# Alerts Menu Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive alerts menu system in the top navigation that displays real-time alert counts and allows users to view and manage their portfolio alerts.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Updates
**File: `src/app/api/alerts/route.ts`**
- Modified the GET endpoint to limit results to the last 20 alerts
- Added `LIMIT 20` to the SQL query to prevent overwhelming the UI with too many alerts
- Alerts are ordered by `created_at DESC` to show the newest first

### 2. New Component: AlertsMenu
**File: `src/components/auth/AlertsMenu.tsx`**
- Created a new dropdown menu component that displays portfolio alerts
- Features:
  - Shows real-time alert count badge on the bell icon
  - Displays alerts in a dropdown menu when clicked
  - Separates triggered alerts from active alerts
  - Shows alert details including:
    - Symbol and market type (stocks/crypto)
    - Alert type (up/down)
    - Target percentage value
    - Triggered status with timestamp
    - Portfolio name
  - Allows users to delete alerts directly from the menu
  - Auto-refreshes alerts every 30 seconds
  - Responsive design with max height and scrolling

### 3. Header Updates
**File: `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`**
- Replaced the watchlist bell icon with the new AlertsMenu component
- Removed unused `useUserPreferences` import and `watchlist` variable
- Cleaned up imports

**File: `src/components/layout/SimpleHeader.tsx`**
- Replaced the watchlist bell icon with the new AlertsMenu component
- Removed unused `useUserPreferences` import and `watchlist` variable
- Cleaned up imports

## Features

### Alert Display
- **Badge Count**: Shows the total number of alerts (both active and triggered)
- **Triggered Alerts Section**: Highlighted with a red "Triggered" badge and alert triangle icon
- **Active Alerts Section**: Clean display of pending alerts
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Green up arrow for upward price alerts
  - Red down arrow for downward price alerts
  - Symbol and market type badges
  - Portfolio name tags

### User Interactions
- Click bell icon to open/close the alerts dropdown
- Click delete button (trash icon) to remove any alert
- Alerts automatically refresh on:
  - Component mount
  - Every 30 seconds (automatic polling)
  - After deleting an alert

### Responsive Design
- Fixed width dropdown (320px)
- Maximum height with scrolling for many alerts
- Mobile-friendly touch interactions
- Prevents dropdown from closing when interacting with alerts

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- Integrates with AuthContext for user authentication
- Independent alert fetching from portfolio page

### API Integration
- GET `/api/alerts` - Fetches user's alerts (limited to 20)
- DELETE `/api/alerts/{alertId}` - Removes specific alert

### Performance
- Optimized re-renders with useCallback
- Efficient polling mechanism (30s intervals)
- Lazy loading - only loads when user is authenticated

## Benefits
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Users can quickly check their alerts without navigating away
2. **Quick Management**: Delete alerts instantly from any page
3. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Easily distinguish between triggered and active alerts
4. **Limited Data**: Only shows last 20 alerts to maintain performance
5. **Auto-refresh**: Keeps alert count and status up-to-date automatically

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add notification sound when alerts trigger
- WebSocket integration for instant alert updates
- Filter alerts by portfolio or market type
- Mark alerts as read/acknowledged
- Navigate to portfolio item when clicking an alert
