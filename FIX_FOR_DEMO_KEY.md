# ‚úÖ Fix Applied for Demo API Key

## What Was Wrong

Your CoinGecko **Demo** key starts with `CG-`, which made the code incorrectly think it was a **Pro** key. This caused it to use the wrong base URL.

## The Fix

Changed from auto-detection to **explicit configuration**:
- **Default**: Uses standard URL (`api.coingecko.com`) - works for Demo and free tier ‚úÖ
- **Pro**: Only uses Pro URL when you explicitly set `COINGECKO_USE_PRO=true`

## What You Need to Do

### ‚úÖ Your Current Setup is Perfect!

Since you have a Demo key, **you don't need to change anything** in your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Your current .env.local is fine:
NEXT_PUBLIC_COINGECKO_API_KEY=CG-YourDemoKey

# DO NOT add COINGECKO_USE_PRO
# The default behavior now works for Demo keys!
```

### üöÄ Just Restart the Dev Server

1. **Stop** the current server (if running)
2. **Restart** it:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test** the crypto search:
   - Search for "BTC" or "ethereum"
   - Should work without errors now!

## What You'll See

### ‚úÖ Success (in console):
```
Using CoinGecko with header: x-cg-demo-api-key and base URL: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3
```

### ‚ùå Old Error (should be gone):
```
CoinGecko failed, using Polygon for crypto: Error: HTTP 400...
```

## Summary

| What Changed | Before | After |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| **Detection** | Auto (broken) | Explicit (works) |
| **Default URL** | Tried to guess | Always standard URL |
| **Demo Keys** | ‚ùå Failed | ‚úÖ Work by default |
| **Pro Keys** | ‚ùå Failed | ‚úÖ Work with flag |

## If You Later Upgrade to Pro

Only then would you need to add:
```bash
COINGECKO_USE_PRO=true
```

But for Demo (your current setup), **nothing needed**! üéâ

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - Just restart the server!
